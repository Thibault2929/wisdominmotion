  <h2>The people who teach us</h2>

    <!-- Paste your paragraphs here -->
    <p>As we move through life, we may encounter people in unexpected ways, forming bonds we never anticipated. Sometimes these connections develop quickly, leaving us unsure how to define them, as we navigate the delicate space between what is good for ourselves and for the other person. In some cases, those bonds, in a harsh but necessary way, are not meant to last. They may be yet another step in our life’s journey, teaching us invaluable lessons about ourselves and revealing what makes us feel truly alive. They test us, shape us, and expose our buried desires, helping us learn how to navigate the in-between of our inner world and that of others, especially those closest to us. Finding this subtle balance is arguably one of the most challenging aspects of human relationships—one that cannot be fully intellectualized and must be explored firsthand, so that not only the mind but the body can retain the lesson.</p>

<p><em>I first met her at the Tandem evening organized by the University of Freiburg. I was first at the Spanish table, but at some point, feeling a bit tired as I was not yet fluent in the language, I wandered over to the nearby French table, hoping to find an engaging conversation. That’s when she appeared. She seemed a little shy, unsure whether to join, stating that her French was limited, even though it was quite good. She had a gentle, warm smile that immediately caught my attention. She had black hair, full lips, and large, expressive brown eyes. Her voice was soft yet quietly expressive, carrying a gentle rhythm that made her words feel reassuring. It was late autumn and she was bundled up in thick layers by which I concluded she might always feel a little cold.</em></p>

<p><em>We were joined by a third person, and that brief exchange marked my first real interaction with her. I remember the conversation drifting toward the question of the Earth’s finite resources—a subject that carried particular weight for me at the time, as I was an undergraduate student in geology. She listened closely as I shared my thoughts, following with genuine interest. Before we parted, I mentioned a book I had recently read—one that claimed to offer solutions to our future societal challenges, yet devoted barely a page to the ever-growing demand for mineral resources. I hadn’t liked it much and had written a critical comment about it. A few days later, to my surprise, she told me she had read that comment and was deeply impressed by it. A seemingly small act that left a strong impression on me.</em></p>

<p><em>I saw her very rarely after that, a few times at the Tandem and once at a Franco-German night. She told me about her upcoming trip to Scotland in April with her partner, who I learned was French and lived in Toulouse. I invited her to come to my place to pick up the books and maps I had about the country, as I had spent a great deal of time there, my ex-girlfriend being from Glasgow. I shared advice about hikes, places to visit, and the existing bothies—the small, rudimentary mountain huts once used by shepherds that hikers can use for free. When she came over to pick them up, we talked about Celtic songs from Brittany and the Isles, and that is when I first heard her sing. I was stunned by her voice, and in that moment I understood how much music meant to her. It seemed to be more than a passion—something deeply woven into who she was, and who she wanted to become.</em></p>

<p><em>Months later, I saw her again at a barbecue, at the cinema and during a hike with one of her best friends who had come to visit her. Our interactions remained occasional and I continued to support her in small ways—organizing a bicycle for an upcoming tour she was planning with a friend around Lake Constance. It is an act that is deeply engrained in me, helping friends whenever I can, may it be in equipment or expertise. I felt great joy when she shared pictures of her tour, an occasion for me to daydream while I remained in Freiburg.</em></p>

<p><em>One day, as we met once more at the Tandem, I began telling her about a very special place in the south of France, in the Roya Valley near Nice, in the mountains, where some friends were about to celebrate the ten-year anniversary of their farm. She ended up asking whether she could join for the weekend. I was a little reluctant at first—not because I didn’t want her to come, but because questions arose in my mind: whether the place might be too rudimentary for her, what her partner would think if she joined me, how she would feel among people who might speak only French, and whether the place would meet her expectations. But then I was reminded that she had traveled more than I had in the past with her van, that she had spent time in France with her partner, how much her French had improved since we last met, her love for authentic places, and the fact that many of the people there also spoke English and German. All those thoughts happened within a few seconds after she expressed her wish to join and I heard myself consenting to her request.</em></p>

<p><em>Two weeks before heading south, she sent me a voice message saying that she would perform at a small festival north of Freiburg with her loop station, singing Greek songs. I told her I would be there. It was summer, and I enjoyed a bicycle ride along the edge of the Black Forest. I met her partner for the first time, and seeing them together, they gave the impression of two people who had found each other. I told him about the ten-year anniversary and tried to convince him to come. I wanted him to know that he was also invited, but he declined, saying he couldn't make it that weekend. That evening, I heard her perform on stage for the first time, and it was deeply inspiring and moving, bringing me even to tears, as her voice touched me profoundly, bringing me back to when I was roaming the peaks of the Alps, feeling small and in awe of the sublime. I soaked it in as I sat on the carpets laid on the grass, trying to etch the experience deep within me.</em></p>

<p><em>We left Freiburg late in the afternoon with her van, aiming to reach Aosta by evening, where we would spend the night before covering the remaining distance the next morning. We talked a lot during the trip. She shared more about her inner world, about her past and present relationships as well as her current struggles. I found myself mostly listening, sometimes offering personal input without judgement, trying to hold both perspectives as well as I could. It was during that drive south that our bond began to unfold—from there, we truly started to know each other. I told her about my past relationship, trying to share my insights, the struggles I had faced, and the lessons I had taken from it.</em></p>

<p><em>When we arrived in Aosta, she spent the night in her van while I disappeared into the woods to hang my hammock and tarp. I was accustomed to it, feeling deeply secure under the thick canopy of leaves above me, falling asleep while listening to the rattling of trees’ branches in the wind and the wandering of the clouds in the sky. The next morning I met her back at the van, and we went for a cold bath in the nearby river while enjoying a beautiful view over the snowy peak of the Grand Combin. We hurried back as she had an important online meeting, and I headed toward the town of Aosta, where I was delighted to discover that people spoke French as well—the region was bilingual, a remnant of the time when the valley was still part of the Duchy of Savoy. I enjoyed a cappuccino before heading back. We both then thoroughly explored the town together before resuming our journey along the Po Valley.</em></p>
