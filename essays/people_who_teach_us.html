  <h2>The people who teach us</h2>

    <!-- Paste your paragraphs here -->
    <p>As we move through life, we may encounter people in unexpected ways, forming bonds we never anticipated. Sometimes these connections develop quickly, leaving us unsure how to define them, as we navigate the delicate space between what is good for ourselves and for the other person. In some cases, those bonds, in a harsh but necessary way, are not meant to last. They may be yet another step in our life’s journey, teaching us invaluable lessons about ourselves and revealing what makes us feel truly alive. They test us, shape us, and expose our buried desires, helping us learn how to navigate the in-between of our inner world and that of others, especially those closest to us. Finding this subtle balance is arguably one of the most challenging aspects of human relationships—one that cannot be fully intellectualized and must be explored firsthand, so that not only the mind but the body can retain the lesson.</p>

<p><em>I first met her at the Tandem evening organized by the University of Freiburg. I was first at the Spanish table, but at some point, feeling a bit tired as I was not yet fluent in the language, I wandered over to the nearby French table, hoping to find an engaging conversation. That’s when she appeared. She seemed a little shy, unsure whether to join, stating that her French was limited, even though it was, in my opinion, quite good. She had a gentle, warm smile that immediately caught my attention. She had black hair, full lips, and large, expressive brown eyes. Her voice was soft yet quietly expressive, carrying a gentle rhythm that made her words feel reassuring. It was late autumn and she was bundled up in thick layers by which I concluded she might always feel a little cold.</em></p>

<p><em>We were joined by a third person, and that brief exchange marked my first real interaction with her. I remember the conversation drifting toward the question of the Earth’s finite resources—a subject that carried particular weight for me at the time, as I was an undergraduate student in geology. The topic stirred something in me, and she listened closely, following my thoughts with genuine interest. Before we parted, I mentioned a book I had recently read—one that claimed to offer solutions to our future societal challenges, yet devoted barely a page to the ever-growing demand for mineral resources. I hadn’t liked it much and had written a critical comment about it. A few days later, to my surprise, she told me she had read that comment and was deeply impressed by it. A seemingly small act that left a strong impression on me.</em></p>
