  <h2>The people who teach us</h2>

    <!-- Paste your paragraphs here -->
    <p>As we move through life, we may encounter people in unexpected ways, forming bonds we never anticipated. Sometimes these connections develop quickly, leaving us unsure how to define them, as we navigate the delicate space between what is good for ourselves and for the other person. In some cases, those bonds, in a harsh but necessary way, are not meant to last. They may be yet another step in our life’s journey, teaching us invaluable lessons about ourselves and revealing what makes us feel truly alive. They test us, shape us, and expose our buried desires, helping us learn how to navigate the in-between of our inner world and that of others, especially those closest to us. Finding this subtle balance is arguably one of the most challenging aspects of human relationships—one that cannot be fully intellectualized and must be explored firsthand, so that not only the mind but the body can retain the lesson.</p>
