    <div class="poem">
      <p>I’ve never seen a perfect life<br>
      All I see are travelers, students of being,<br>
      who fill the world with their existence<br>
      And from it they come to learn,<br>
      who they are and where they wish to go<br>
      And on that path they tend to find,<br>
      their journey could be sweetened<br>
      when spent along someone’s side</p>

      <p>I’ve never seen a perfect love<br>
      but two people seeking connection<br>
      Forgetting that togetherness requires balance<br>
      Between predictability and innovation<br>
      Commitment and freedom<br>
      Journey and home<br>
      Speech and listening<br>
      Giving and taking</p>

      <p>I’ve never met the perfect person<br>
      who has all the wisdom of this world<br>
      Only people seeking to learn and teach<br>
      with humility and an open ear<br>
      Who understand that small details<br>
      if ignored and left aside<br>
      swell into storms that shall prevail</p>

      <p>But should all end up falling apart<br>
      for compromise could not be met<br>
      Take the lessons, but not the guilt<br>
      for it is not worth dwelling in regret<br>
      You may fall, but only forward<br>
      for the goodness of this world<br>
      is greater than the tragedies of our heart</p>

      <p>If you feel like you have failed<br>
      If you think you are a mess<br>
      You’re not alone with this thought<br>
      Seldom have we been taught<br>
      About the irregularities of our life<br>
      which we often meet with strife<br>
      And yet every tangle has its reason</p>

      <p>For I have never met a stupid person;<br>
      I’ve met people who sometimes did<br>
      things I didn’t understand at first glance,<br>
      but through listening I got the chance<br>
      to understand the whys behind their act<br>
      For the manner we love in the present<br>
      has to cross the gate of our life’s past</p>

      <p>Therefore do not forget that<br>
      this world’s greatest curse,<br>
      is to expect someone to know what you know,<br>
      to see you fully without you saying a word<br>
      on matters we ourselves not fully comprehend<br>
      An expectation doomed to fail<br>
      for only the use of words can help to bond</p>

      <p>Be ready to teach, be ready to learn<br>
      Know how to be a good teacher<br>
      Know how to be a good student<br>
      Love is a skill that takes great effort<br>
      Patience, kindness and humility<br>
      will be your allies on this journey<br>
      For an encounter demands we risk discomfort</p>

      <p>As vulnerability comes with closeness,<br>
      their words may hurt us at our core<br>
      Yet the presence we must hold<br>
      requires humility and courage<br>
      And to acknowledge that reality does not exist<br>
      Merely two truths within two people,<br>
      who wish to be seen and understood</p>

      <p>For only the opening of the mind<br>
      can prevent the closure of the heart<br>
      Some will find refuge through distance instead<br>
      for repair demands we face our hidden parts<br>
      And thus such questioning may overwhelm<br>
      Yet two truths can be held through gentle wisdom<br>
      For love, true love, is never an easy task</p>
