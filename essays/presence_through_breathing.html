  <h2>Presence through breathing</h2>

    <!-- Paste your paragraphs here -->
    <p>A great majority of people will say that life is accelerating the older they get, that the years seem to slip away and before they realise, ten seasons will have passed. This is partly due to a change of perception, in other words, how we experience time. With our life being in constant hustle and our attention distracted by the firm grip of our digital devices, we do not take the time to contemplate the recent past. Too agitated is our mind to stay focused, to simply revisit what was lived. Yet, its exploration can extend our lives significantly as we take notice of forgotten memories – its formation not merely dependent on the occurrence of events, but on the depth of attention we bring to them. When the mind races perpetually forward—planning, anticipating, responding to endless notifications—it registers only superficially. The impressions we gather pass through us without leaving lasting imprints. The weeks blur together not because nothing happened, but because we were not truly present when it did.</p>
      
      <p>This is where the practice of conscious breathing reveals its unexpected value. The Wim Hof method, with its cycles of deep inhalation and prolonged retention, functions as more than physiological training. It serves as an anchor, pulling awareness back into the immediate present. During those thirty to fifty deep breaths and the subsequent holding before the beginning of the next cycle, there is no room for distraction. The body demands full attention—the rhythm of air moving in and out, the tingling in the extremities as our blood becomes more alkaline, the subtle shifts in consciousness as the practice unfolds. The mind, so accustomed to wandering, finds itself naturally tethered to something undeniably real: the breath, the body, the present moment.</p>

        <p><em>After an evening swim at the port of Agaete, I walk back along the natural pools and up the stairs before coming to a halt. The sun is about to set, the air is warm, and the relentless crashing of the waves against the cliffs invites me to sit down and admire the stunning scenery unfolding before my eyes. I settle at the edge of a cliff, the snowy peak of Teide visible in the distance and the natural basins directly below, while the sky slowly surrenders to its daily colorful spectacle. Forty times I breathe in and out, then hold the air for as long as it feels comfortable. As I repeat the cycles, I feel the familiar tingling in my cheeks, toes, hands, and belly. Naturally, without forcing, the mind settles and the senses sharpen. I see clearly the lines of waves coming in, their endless battle as they climb up the rocks before retreating back into the ocean. I hear with greater clarity the sounds around me. I notice the changing colors of the waves, the reflection of the twilight’s colorful hues in the basins, the moving clouds in the distance, and the gradual awakening of the town's lights.</em></p>

          <p>The big brother of trail running is undeniably hiking for both share a similar objective: immersion in nature for the therapeutic qualities it provides. And yet, there seems to be a persistent misunderstanding about why some choose to run instead of simply walk. This distortion might stem from a culture driven by performance, one that misses the fundamental appeal. It is true that competition plays a major role in the sport—it is in our nature to measure what can be measured, reflecting both our competitive instincts and our playfulness. But to narrow trail running solely to physical performance is to do it an injustice. A technical path downhill requires our full attention as a misstep could have severe consequences, forcing our mind to stay in the present moment and thus intensifying the experience as it cannot wander elsewhere. Packing only the necessary enables us to realize what is truly essential and what is carried merely to give us a sense of security. We may gain confidence as we recognize how little is needed, and with experience growing, we take further joy in the liberty of carrying less on our shoulders. There is pleasure in feeling the wind against our face as we rush down, the lightness in our movements reminiscent of a child at play. Thus it is more than mere motion; it is a vivid encounter with the world, and with ourselves.</p>

            <p><em>I try to thread down the valley of Agaete but eventually come to a halt as the uniqueness of the moment becomes evident. I am reminded of what makes me come alive: the presence of beauty and the sublime. I am blessed by the recent rains that have painted this remote dell in vibrant, verdant hues. The weight of my regrets at that time—centered on the loss of a recent, brief but deeply intense friendship—begins to lift. What my mind already knew, my soul now finally integrates. It is as if the cliffs, in their timeless magnificence, are laughing at me, saying: why are you concerned with what is beyond your control? Why resist what cannot be altered? You have grieved, you have learned. You have suffered enough. Now let go, for life is too beautiful for lingering in sorrow.</em></p>

              <p>It is not to say that trail running is superior to any other sport, but to appreciate what it provides beyond its physical benefits. Mind, body, and soul are intrinsically linked, and when surrounded by the ever-forgiving, non-judgmental nature and confronted with physical exhaustion, a space is created to see what might otherwise remain hidden. For the more sensitive among us, this can be frightening, and we may find ourselves crying for what we have been holding in our chest — now finally able to be released, finally felt. In those moments, we need to accept what is happening within ourselves, not fight it, but allow it to pass. For it is a blessing to be connected to our inner parts, to no longer run away from what might have been stored deep inside. And at the end of the experience, clarity will remain. </p>

                <p><em>I stand at the Refugio de Hornillo, from where a narrow path leads back to Agaete along the widening barranco. I take a few deep breaths and turn around, not wanting to miss any detail—as if trying to grasp the deeper layers of a painting, to understand its meaning, its core message. Only when darkness slowly takes over do I finally focus entirely on the running, my heart lightened and the air gradually warming up as I descend closer to the coast.</em></p>

                  <p>Covering great distances while fully immersed in nature, the awakening of the senses and the lightness of carrying so little—these provide a specific kind of freedom, one that heals precisely because it demands our complete presence. What we carry back is not merely exhaustion and the satisfaction of having seen new places, but also a quiet transformation: the clarity and peace that come from confronting ourselves.</p>
