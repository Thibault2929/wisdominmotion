  <h2>Presence through breathing</h2>

    <!-- Paste your paragraphs here -->
    <p>A great majority of people will say that life is accelerating the older they get, that the years seem to slip away and before they realise, ten seasons will have passed. This is partly due to a change of perception, in other words, how we experience time. With our life being in constant hustle and our attention distracted by the firm grip of our digital devices, we do not take the time to contemplate the recent past. Too agitated is our mind to stay focused, to simply revisit what was lived. Yet, its exploration can extend our lives significantly as we take notice of forgotten memories – its formation not merely dependent on the occurrence of events, but on the depth of attention we bring to them. When the mind races perpetually forward—planning, anticipating, responding to endless notifications—it registers only superficially. The impressions we gather pass through us without leaving lasting imprints. The weeks blur together not because nothing happened, but because we were not truly present when it did.</p>
      
      <p>This is where the practice of conscious breathing reveals its unexpected value. The Wim Hof method, named after the man who created it, with its cycles of deep inhalation and prolonged retention, functions as more than physiological training. It serves as an anchor, pulling awareness back into the immediate present. During those thirty to fifty deep breaths and the subsequent holding before the beginning of the next cycle, there is no room for distraction. The body demands full attention—the rhythm of air moving in and out, the tingling in the extremities as our blood becomes more alkaline, the subtle shifts in consciousness as the practice unfolds. The mind, so accustomed to wandering, finds itself naturally tethered to something undeniably real: the breath, the body, the present moment.</p>

        <p><em>After an evening swim at the port of Agaete, I walk back along the natural pools and up the stairs before coming to a halt. The sun is about to set, the air is warm, and the relentless crashing of the waves against the cliffs invites me to sit down and admire the stunning scenery unfolding before my eyes. I settle at the edge of a cliff, the snowy peak of Teide visible in the distance and the natural basins directly below, while the sky slowly surrenders to its daily colorful spectacle. Forty times I breathe in and out, then hold the air for as long as it feels comfortable. As I repeat the cycles, I feel the familiar tingling in my cheeks, toes, hands, and belly. Naturally, without forcing, the mind settles and the senses sharpen. I see clearly the lines of waves coming in, their endless battle as they climb up the rocks before retreating back into the ocean. I hear with greater clarity the sounds around me. I notice the changing colors of the waves, the reflection of the twilight’s colorful hues in the basins, the moving clouds in the distance, and the gradual awakening of the town's lights.</em></p>

          <p>And while the mind is present, past memories may resurface, gently, allowing us to relive them a second time. We stray through a set of images, scents, and emotions. We might reflect on its meaning, how it might have changed us, how it influenced us in ways we haven't yet considered. And more importantly, we allow ourselves to live it all again, savor it, and thus etch it ever deeper into our memory. At times, neglected emotions buried deep within us may resurface naturally, and we may find ourselves vulnerable. Yet tears are the gateway to our souls, and we should not be afraid to let them flow. Acknowledging them suffices, and perhaps with time we may understand the reasons for their appearance—not that we drown in them, but rather navigate safely through the waters.</p>
