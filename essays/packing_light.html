  <h2>Packing light</h2>

    <!-- Paste your paragraphs here -->
   <p>Packing only the necessary is a skill, one which comes with experience strengthened with the number of travels undertaken. Carrying little on our shoulders gives us a liberty which undeniably intensifies the joy of wandering abroad. To achieve lightness, we must first accept that our persona will differ from the one at home. Ultimately, we need to limit ourselves to what we truly need. Yet what we take will depend on our trip, and thus the essential and the optional will vary.</p>

<p><em>I packed my rucksack for the completion of the GR20 in Corsica on a Monday morning while drinking a cappuccino, shortly before leaving the house. Being accustomed to this, I gathered all the essentials within half an hour: a sleeping bag, sleeping mattress, inflatable pillow, lightweight tent, two T-shirts, one pair of underwear, one pair of socks, warm black leggings, a warm sweatshirt, a very light rain jacket, two cables, a power bank, a head torch, a plastic envelope and its contents, two 500 ml soft flasks, a lightweight microfiber towel, soap, a toothbrush, and some toothpaste. I was wearing the rest of the equipment, which consisted of a T-shirt, a mobile phone, underwear, a small bum bag, a pair of socks, trail running shoes, and two bandanas. I arranged everything as best as I could in my 30-liter rucksack and, after finishing my cappuccino, left the house for the main train station. Taken by wanderlust, I was excited for the adventure that lay ahead.</p></em>

<p style="margin-bottom: 3em;"> The list may vary, as we might intend to sleep in hostels or work remotely while traveling. The two following questions can help while packing: Do I truly need this item, and if yes, why? Is there an alternative to what I think I need? This highly depends on the type of trip we’re planning, but one can ask oneself whether it is truly necessary to pack flip-flops, another book, or an excessive amount of clothes. Alternatives could be walking in your shoes instead, reading books in digital form, and packing soap to wash your few outfits. In the end, the greatest comfort remains wandering with lightness instead of persisting in taking the luxuries we are so accustomed to back home for these become a burden when carried on our backs.</p>


<p><strong>More questions could be:</strong></p>

<p>Do I need protection for my laptop?</p>

<p>Do I need a separate bag for my bathroom essentials?</p>

<p>Do I need to carry this flask of water with me?</p>

<p>Do I need this amount of food?</p> 
    
<p>Do I need to take a cooker with me?</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 3em;"> Do I need to take a warm jacket with me?</p>


<p><strong>Some answers could be: </strong></p>

<p>I could pack my laptop carefully and cushion it with clothes.</p>

<p>I could take some cheap, lightweight plastic bags and pack my bathroom essentials in them.</p>

<p>I could take two 500 ml soft flasks that take little space when empty.</p>

<p>I could check the availability of grocery stores beforehand and pack accordingly.</p>

<p>I could eat food that doesn't require cooking.</p>

<p>I could pack merino shirts and a pullover instead and thus only need a jacket that protects me from the rain.</p>
